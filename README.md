# Code Coverage With Jacoco

---

This is a sample project to showcase measuring code coverage with Jacoco Plugin
and integration with SonarQube for tracking code metrics.

For sample project, I am going to build a simple rest api which provides the some
data for a Book mode. For mock data I will be using and a in-mem dictionary database


Point of the project is to show how to measure your test coverage with jacoco and integration with sonarqube.
